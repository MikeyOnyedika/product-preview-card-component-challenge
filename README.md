## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Setting up CSS custom properties also called CSS Variables - they'll prevent you from having to run around CSS files when you need to change the value of say a font size

### Continued development

These are some of the things I am still working on/struggling with;

- Properly writing semantic HTML
- Properly setting up css variables and general class styles
